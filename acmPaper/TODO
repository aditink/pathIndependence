A list of things that the paper doesn't yet address that I would like to work in/major TODO points:

- Make a better case for a verification tool for units of measure-ey programs
- Explain when polynomial path checker is actually faster than optimal paths checker, an example might help.
- Figure out what's up with batch checker
